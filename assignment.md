# Terrific FullStack Developer Home Assignment

## 1. Create a ToDo list app (both Backend and Frontend) which supports adding, removing to do items, as well as mark them done.

**Backend in NodeJS; Frontend in Angular or React. Use typescript.**

### Remarks (how we will value your delivery):

a. API first. We should be able to use the backend part only and do operations on the list by sending API requests.
b. Clean and clear code
c. Easy setup and delivery
d. Production environment mindset
e. Other things we expect to see that will come from you, without us asking for it.

## 2. System Design and Architecture

Design a live-shopping streaming application that allows a host to stream video, promoting products, with users able to watch and purchase these products in real-time. The system should manage inventory in real-time to prevent over-ordering and ensure fair access to limited stock items.

### Requirements:

1. **Scalability:** Your design should support a large number of concurrent users both for streaming video and placing orders.
2. **Real-Time Inventory Management:** Propose a method for real-time synchronization of inventory across all users to prevent over-ordering.
3. **Fairness Mechanism:** Describe a strategy to prevent inventory "hogging" by a few users, ensuring all interested users have a chance to order.
4. **Technologies and Frameworks:** Suggest technologies and frameworks suitable for building this system, with justifications for each choice.

### Deliverables:

A system architecture document including:

- i. High-level architecture diagrams.
- ii. Detailed descriptions of components and their interactions.
- iii. Justification of chosen technologies and frameworks.
