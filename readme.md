# Fullstack Todo App & System Design Project

This repository contains two main parts:

1.  A Fullstack Todo Application.
2.  A System Design and Architecture document for a Live Shopping feature.

This project was mostly generated by AI under my direction, supervision, and full understanding.

## Assignment

## Part 1: Todo App

This is a fullstack todo application built with a TypeScript backend (Express.js) and a React frontend.

**Key Features & Technologies:**

- Strict TypeScript
- ESLint for linting
- Prettier for code formatting

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the `fullstack todo app/backend` directory and run `pnpm install`.
3.  Navigate to the `fullstack todo app/frontend` directory and run `pnpm install`.

### Running the Application

1.  **Backend:**
    - Navigate to `fullstack todo app/backend`.
    - Run `pnpm dev`. The backend server will start (typically on port 3000 or as configured).
    - The OpenAPI documentation for the backend can be accessed at the server's root URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/`).
2.  **Frontend:**
    - Navigate to `fullstack todo app/frontend`.
    - Run `pnpm dev`. The frontend development server will start.
    - The application will typically open automatically in your browser, or you can open the URL provided in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

### Testing

- Tests can be run using the test commands specified in the `package.json` files of the backend and frontend respectively.
- Alternatively, Vitest extension can be used for running tests.
- A suite of API tests (cURL, HTTPie, Insomnia, VSCode REST Client) are available in the [`fullstack todo app/backend/api-tests/`](fullstack%20todo%20app/backend/api-tests/) directory.

### Development

- For a better development experience, consider installing the recommended extensions listed in the VSCode workspace settings (if a `.vscode/extensions.json` file is provided).

### Backend Details

The backend is based on the [Express TypeScript Boilerplate by GeekyAnts](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/express-typescript). This boilerplate was chosen for its robust structure, including:

- **Modular Design:** Separates concerns into routes, controllers, services, and repositories, making the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and scale.
- **Built-in Middleware:** Includes common middleware for request logging, error handling, and rate limiting.
- **OpenAPI Documentation:** Integrated support for generating OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation, which is crucial for API discoverability and testing.
- **User API:** Includes a pre-built user API, which was left as is for potential future extensions or as a reference.

**Todo Functionality Documentation:**

More details about the todo-specific API and functionality can be found in [todos.md](fullstack%20todo%20app/todos.md).

**Optional Improvements & Future Considerations:**

- **API Improvements:** (No specific improvements were listed in the backend's original readme. This section can be updated if specific improvements are identified or implemented.)
- **Deployment:**
  - The application could be deployed to platforms like Cloudflare. This would likely require changing the backend from Express.js to a framework more suited for serverless environments (e.g., Hono.js or directly using Cloudflare Workers).
  - Implementing user-specific data storage with sign-in (e.g., username-based) would be a valuable addition.
- **Monorepo Structure:** Explore different monorepo solutions (e.g., Turborepo, Nx) for better management of the frontend and backend projects.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Implement E2E tests using frameworks like Playwright or Cypress.
- **CI/CD:** Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline with version control (e.g., GitHub Actions).

### Frontend Details

- **Build Tool (rspack):** Chosen for its popularity, community support, fast build speeds, and comprehensive capabilities.
- **Framework (React):** Selected due to its widespread adoption, large ecosystem, and developer familiarity.
- **Styling (styled-jsx):** Suggested by Rsbuild (the underlying bundler for rspack) and supported by AI recommendations for its component-scoped styling approach.

## Part 2: System Design and Architecture

This section outlines the system design for a "Live Shopping" feature.

The design document can be found here: [Live Shopping Architecture](system%20design%20and%20architecture/live_shopping_architecture.md)

This document was AI-generated and reviewed. It appears to be a correct and good starting point for planning the implementation of such a feature.
